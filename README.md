# Firefox-Photon-userChrome
Custom Firefox userChrome to replicate the style of Firefox Photon, with some changes from later firefox versions and small personal touches. I mainly just wanted something to suit my tastes while being simple and easy to maintain.

Mostly comprised of features pulled from the projects below.

Notable personal touches:
* Urlbar border highlight on hover
* Selected tab line extends to multiselected tabs
* Square tab groups without padding
* Applied accent colour in more areas
* Updated tab separator behaviour
* Enlarged tab close icon
